\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Dr. Thomas Keller for his guidance and time helping me write and edit this thesis. Without him, this document would not be what it is. His Research Enhancement Program (REP) Grant from Texas State University-San Marcos helped support me during the writing process.

I would also like to thank my committee members, Dr. Eugene Curtin and Dr. Maria Acosta, for giving their time and expertise for this project.

Finally, thank you to all my friends and family who encouraged me along the way.
